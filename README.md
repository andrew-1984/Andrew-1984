# About me

I am a geophysicist working on AI technologies. 

I have a background in coding python and am now looking to upgrade my skill set into cloud based systems, setting up dedicated databases, and of course, collaborative coding through GitHub. 

I have held my GitHub account for several years, but am re-learning the basics to take fuller advantage of the collaborative benefits of GitHub.
